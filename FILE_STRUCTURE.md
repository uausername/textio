# File Structure Plan

The repository is currently documentation-only. The following structure describes the layout once development begins.

```
textio/
├── src/              # Application source code
│   ├── editor/       # Core editor components
│   ├── extensions/   # AI-generated and built-in extensions
│   └── ui/           # Rendering logic for manifests
├── tests/            # Unit and integration tests
├── scripts/          # Utility scripts (build, lint, etc.)
├── docs/             # Additional project documentation
└── package.json      # Project metadata and npm scripts
```

This structure is expected to evolve as features are implemented.
