# UI/UX Plan

The editor starts with an almost blank canvas and grows with user intent.

## Core Concepts
- **Minimal Start**: initial interface shows only a text area and a command palette.
- **Slash Commands**: users type `/` to request features or actions.
- **AI-Suggested Panels**: LLM proposes UI panels (e.g., formatting toolbar, outline view) which the user can accept or dismiss.
- **Customizable Layout**: accepted panels can be rearranged, hidden, or removed through commands.

## User Flow
1. User types `/bold` â†’ LLM loads a formatting panel.
2. User removes panel via `/hide formatting`.
3. LLM stores layout preferences for future sessions.

## Accessibility & Feedback
- Keyboard-first interactions with accessible labels.
- Lightweight notifications explain new panels or commands.
- Undo/rollback available for AI-added features.
